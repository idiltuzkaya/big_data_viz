## **Preface**

### Motivation and Goal

This booklet was born out of a growing need to communicate complex data in a clear and accessible way. As data grows in volume and complexity, visual tools have become essential for uncovering insights that might otherwise remain hidden.

Motivated by a personal interest in data visualization, this project also aims to fill the gaps left by existing resources—many of which focus either too heavily on code or abstract theory. Our goal is to provide a guide that is technically sound yet simple and intuitive, aimed at readers with a basic understanding of data.

While various tools exist for visualization, this booklet focuses primarily on R, emphasizing its strengths in flexibility, reproducibility, and statistical integration. We also briefly compare R to other tools where relevant, to highlight why it was chosen and how it supports effective data storytelling from preparation to final presentation.

### Challenges and Solutions During the Project

Throughout the project, we encountered several challenges—both technical and conceptual. One of the first difficulties was handling large and complex datasets efficiently within the R environment. Some of the packages required for big data visualization demanded careful memory management and unfamiliar workflows, especially when working with tools like SparkR and Arrow.

Another major challenge was choosing the right type of visualization for different kinds of data and ensuring that the graphics remained both accurate and interpretable. It often took multiple iterations to find the right balance between simplicity and completeness.

We also spent considerable time understanding the underlying structure of the data and preparing it for analysis. Missing values, inconsistent formats, and merging different data sources required a lot of manual adjustment and trial-and-error.

Despite these challenges, we approached each problem methodically—consulting documentation, testing alternative solutions, and learning from examples and community discussions. These experiences not only strengthened our understanding of data visualization in R, but also improved our overall problem-solving skills in working with real-world data.

### Target Audience

This booklet is intended for students, early-stage researchers, and data enthusiasts who want to strengthen their understanding of data visualization using R. It assumes only a basic familiarity with data analysis and aims to present both core principles and practical examples in a clear and accessible way, making it useful for both beginners and those looking to refresh their skills.

### Thanks

This project was carried out as part of a summer internship at the University of Edinburgh, supported by the Erasmus+ programme. We would like to thank Ozan Evkaya, PhD for his valuable guidance and support throughout the process. His feedback and expertise greatly contributed to the development of this booklet.
